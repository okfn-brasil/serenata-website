  tagline: Artificial Intelligence for social control of public administration
  about: An open project that uses data science - the same technologies used by giants like Google, Facebook and Netflix - for the purpose of monitoring public spending and sharing information in a way accessible to everyone.
  rosie: "Serenata has created <a href='https://twitter.com/RosieDaSerenata' class='purple'>Rosie</a>: an artificial intelligence who analyzes Brazilian congresspeople expenses while they are in office. Rosie can find suspicious spendings and engage citizens in the discussion about these findings."
  jarbas: "To allow people to visualize and make sense of data Rosie generates, we have created <a href='https://jarbas.serenata.ai/' class='purple'>Jarbas</a>. In this website users can browse congresspeople expenses and get details about each one of the suspicions. It is the starting point to validate a suspicion."

about:
  title: Operation Serenata de Amor
  who_contributed: Contributors
  paragraph_one: We are a technology project that uses artificial intelligence to audit public accounts and support social control. The idea came from the data scientist <a href="https://twitter.com/irio"> Irio Musskopf </a>, as a way to actively participate in the democratic process, overseeing public spending. When sharing the idea with friends, it didn't take long for the project be spread all over the country, with a team of 10 people and more than 600 volunteers willing to do it.
  paragraph_two: And then, the Operation Serenata de Amor has started, focused on monitoring, with the help of technology, the reimbursements made by the Parliamentary Activity Charge (CEAP) - money that costs food, transportation, lodging and even expenses with culture and TV signatures of parliamentarians.
  paragraph_three: On September 7, 2016, our first collective financing campaign was alive, which managed to raise approximately R$ 80,000, 30% more than the amount requested, enough to finance the operations of the team for the first 90 days.
  paragraph_four: Since then, our work, based on information and transparency, has gained space in events and lectures around the world, and has been prominent in the media, being covered by more than 90 journalistics vehicles, including the largest in the country, such as <a href="https://globoplay.globo.com/v/6267741/programa/" target="_blank">Fantastico</a>, <a href="https://globoplay.globo.com/v/5608268/" target="_blank">Jornal Nacional</a> and <a href="http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/01/1852180-jovens-criam-robo-que-monitora-despesas-de-deputados-federais.shtml" target="_blank">Folha de S. Paulo</a>, and a great relevance in the scenario of social control in Brazil.

  question_one: 1. What does the name Serenata de Amor mean?
  answer_one: 'There are three reasons: <br>1 - We were inspired by the Toblerone Affair, a case in which a Swedish politician was pushed to resign after being caught paying simple Toblerone chocolate bar with public money. That’s what we want to do: empower social control of public expenditures including values as low as a chocolate bar. <br>2 - It sounds like a nonsense operation name typical from the Brazilian Federal Police, and that’s very cool. <br>3 - It literally means love serenade — so this is our love serenade to Brazil.'
  question_two: 2. Who is responsible for the project?
  answer_two: 'We are a group of technology enthusiasts. The project started as the data scientist <a href="//twitter.com/irio" target="_blank">Irio Musskopf</a>’s initiative, it has grown and today it has a life of its own. Every code is open, and now we have a team of 10 professionals, plus hundreds of volunteers: collaborators from all over the world, including journalists and researchers.'
  question_three: 3. Where are you?
  answer_three: Our team is spread across different cities and countries. We benefit from technology to host meetings, discuss the project, and keep up with the work remotely, without needing a physical venue to gather.
  question_four: 4. What is open source?
  answer_four: Open source is a term used to describe open source code distribution, in which everyone interested in contributing to the evolution of the project can freely add their ideas without paying for license or intellectual property. In other words, Serenata is free for anyone to access.
  question_five: 5. Which data we use?
  answer_five: We use public data - whether data made public by the Access to Information Law (LAI in the Portuguese acronym), or private data publicly available from companies such as Google, Foursquare, Yelp etc. In the public sphere we obtain data from the Chamber of Deputies, Federal Revenue, Brazilian Government Transparency Portal, data.gov.br etc.
  question_six: 6. What is CEAP - Quota for the Exercise of Parliamentary Activity?
  answer_six: The <a href="http://www.camara.gov.br/cota-parlamentar" target="_blank">Quota for Exercise of Parliamentary Activity</a> (CEAP in the acronym in Portuguese) is a monthly amount of up to R$ 45 thousand that each Chamber of Deputies Member is entitled to reimbursement for expenses that are not fit for public bidding. A lunch or taxi payment, for example.
  question_seven: 7. What is the difference between an irregularity and a suspicion?
  answer_seven:  'Good question! Rosie, our robot, identifies suspicions, that is to say, outlier behaviors. She achieves that  using algorithms in a fully automatic way. She observes spending that does not follow what was expected for a given context, such as a very high expenditure on a single meal, arguably something suspicious. But not everything Rosie finds is necessarily irregular. After she lists her suspicions a human is needed in order to confirm or decline her findings. A irregularity is anything that goes against what is written in the norms, regulations and laws: overpriced expenses, food payments to third parties and other things you might have seen here and there.'
  question_eight: 8. Why do not you talk about political parties?
  answer_eight: Have you noticed that parliamentarians change parties quite often? The is why we avoid indexes and classification of data based on parties of our congresspeople. In addition, our main goal is information, not setting a witch-hunt, promoting hate speech or polarizing between right and left.
  question_nine: 9. How can I get in touch to ask a questions, make compliments or share suggestions?
  answer_nine: 'You can contact us through the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/operacaoSerenataDeAmor/" target="_blank"> Facebook page </a> or by <a href = "mailto:contact@serenata.ai "target =" _ blank "> email </a>. If you are from the technical area, you can talk to us <a href="https://github.com/datasciencebr/" target="_blank"> direct by GitHub </a>, too.'
  question_ten: 10. What is the technical communication channel of the project?
  answer_ten: We're currently using English, in a <a href="https://telegram.me/joinchat/AKDWc0BDOqriD1n-mntRBg" target="_blank">Telegram open group</a>. You are very welcome to join him.
  question_eleven: 11. Why is the technical communication held in English?
  answer_eleven: We have a community created around the project that goes beyond Brazil – that is to say, people from other countries interested in contributing. Within the GitHub repository and the Telegram group we chose to use the English language so we can include the point of view of these people. In addition, several people from other countries have shown interest in our code since day zero. Lastly, by keeping the code and all technical documentation in English we make it easy for our effort to be used in other countries too.
  question_twelve: 12. What is Jarbas?
  answer_twelve: <a href='//jarbas.serenata.ai/'>Jarbas</a> is the web platform to visualize data Rosie, our robot, uses and generates. Jarbas is crucial for the human investigative work that follows Rosie’s task. Lastly Jarbas was created mostly as an internal tool and gradually we are investing in his UX and UI to transform him in a great public utility tool.
  question_thirteen: 13. What is Rosie?
  answer_thirteen: <a href="https://github.com/datasciencebr/rosie" target="_blank"> Rosie </a> is our robot. She has been programmed to identify suspicious uses of public expenditure, starting with CEAP. She analyzes every reimbursement claimed by our congresspeople telling us what are the reasons that make some of them suspicious.
  question_fourteen: 14. Where is Rosie?
  answer_fourteen: 'Rosie is a piece of software we call a robot because it performs its work in an autonomous and automatic way. In other words, someone coded Rosie and "put her to work". Next she handles all the tasks by herself: download available data from the sources, analyzes it, runs algorithms (hypotheses) and finally identifies suspicions. Because she is a computer program she can be installed by anyone who has intermediate skills in tech, but she does not have a face or looks like any humanoid we see in movies.'
  question_fifteen: 15. How can I contribute to the project?
  answer_fifteen: You can contribute to the project with <a href="https://github.com/datasciencebr/serenata-de-amor">code</a>, helping to <a href="apoia.se/serenata">maintain the team</a>, with ideas,  <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23serenatadeamor" target="_blank">retweeting</a> and sharing.

To  directly contribute to the maintenance of the project you can tip us at <a href="https://apoia.se/serenata" target="_blank">apoia.se</a>.
  question_sixteen: 16. Do you act in municipal ways?
  answer_sixteen: 'Unfortunately, we have not started to act in smaller areas yet, and that is due to technical limitations: we do not have a team to scale the work and there is little standardization of data in the municipal spheres. This means that we would have to officially request data and study the structure of the each of the datasets gathered, for each of the cities involved.'
  question_seventeen: 17. an I use the source code of Serenata de Amor in my city, state or country?
  answer_seventeen: Sure, this idea is awesome — and also this idea is one of the main purposes of our adoption of open source.
